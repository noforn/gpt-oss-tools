## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a Python 3.13 virtual environment with **uv**:
   ```bash
   uv venv env --python 3.13
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the required packages using uv's pip:
   ```bash
   uv pip install "openai-agents[litellm]" ddgs requests beautifulsoup4 \
       rich termcolor RestrictedPython pylatexenc fastapi uvicorn \
       python-kasa python-dotenv
   ```
3. Download a tool-capable model (default):
   ```bash
   ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
   ```
4. (Optional) Set up Google Calendar access by placing your `credentials.json` file in the project directory and running:
   ```bash
   python generateToken.py
   ```
   This completes the OAuth flow and creates `token.json` for the calendar tools.
5. Choose an interface to start:
   - **Command line**
     ```bash
     python gpt-oss-tools.py
     ```
   - **Web UI**
     ```bash
     python gpt-oss-tools.py --web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7860
     ```
6. Type your questions or commands. In the CLI, enter `bye` to exit the session or /reset to clear context.
